    <!-- 
    Semantic elements 
convey meaning about the content they contain 
Examples: article, section, header, footer

Non-semantic elements 
donâ€™t convey any specific meaning by themselves and are purely for layout purposes
Examples: div, span

Why to use semantic elements?
Easier to read
Greater accessibility (search engines, screen readers)
More consistent code
