    <!--ontrols attribute adds audio controls (play, pause, volume).

<source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format. 

The text between <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support this element.

autoplay is used to start an audio file automatically.

Note: Some browsers do not allow autoplay. Muted autoplay is always allowed.

Add muted after autoplay to let your audio file start playing automatically, but muted.
